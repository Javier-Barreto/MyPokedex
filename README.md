- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/) is used to retrieve information from the API of pokemon.
- Dependencies used:

## TODOs for this project
As a personal challenge, in the future I would like to add the next things to this project:
- [ ] Improve the display of the results from the query.
- [ ] Add a "Pokemon not found" message when search query retrieves nothing.
- [ ] Add more deailed information such as element types and movements in the pokemon modal.
- [ ] Add filters to the search bar.
- [ ] Add the option to not only display and search pokemons, but also display and search items and berries.

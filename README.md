## Tech Stack
Tech stack:
- This project uses the [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/). Vitejs is a frontend tooling for web development which allows us to create amazing web sites.
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) is the API from where I get the information needed :3.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
